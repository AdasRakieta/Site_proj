# Deprecated Files

This folder contains the original implementation files that have been replaced by the organized utils structure.

## Migration Map

- `cache_helpers.py` → `utils/cache_manager.py`
- `async_mail_manager.py` → `utils/async_manager.py`  
- `minify_assets.py` → `utils/asset_manager.py`

## Important Notes

- These files are kept for reference only
- **DO NOT use these files in new code**
- All functionality has been moved to the `utils/` directory
- The new implementations are improved and better documented
- These files will be removed in a future cleanup

## What Changed

The new organized structure provides:
- Better separation of concerns
- Comprehensive documentation
- Improved error handling
- Better logging and monitoring
- More robust fallback mechanisms
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
